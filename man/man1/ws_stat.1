.TH ws_stat 1 "July 2025" "USER COMMANDS"

.SH NAME
ws_stat \- list workspaces

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ws_stat
[\-h] [\-F FILESYSTEM] [\-g] [\-r] [\-N] [\-R] [\-C] [PATTERN]

.SH DESCRIPTION
Show statistics for
.B workspaces
of the calling user.
The output can be restricted to
.B workspaces
in a certain FILESYSTEM, matching a certain PATTERN, and can be sorted according to different criterias.

The output includes number of files, symlinks and directories of the workspace and the total number of bytes (sum of filesizes).
On Lustre Filesystems, this uses the size on metedata if possible which is cheaper than stat() calls and therefor
.B du.

.B PATTERN
is a unix glob expression, * matches all characters, please be aware that quoting might be required
by your shell.


The idea of the
.B workspace
is to allow the administrator to keep control of filespace in working filesystems,
and to avoid the situations that data of past and finished projects/jobs is idling for
ever on disks. A user can create and dispose arbitrary number of workspaces, they are cheap,
and can be created e.g. for each job.

From the system side,
.B workspaces
will be deleted after beeing expired. A friendly user can release workspaces before the expiration
date using
.B ws_release
which will mark the
.B workspace
for future deletion.

Deletion is probably a task done once a night and not immediately.

If a
.B workspace
was forgotten and expired, it might make sense to contact the administrator,
as he probaly can restore a workspace for some time, if disk space is not low.
Check if
.ws_restore
is available allowing you to restore workspaces on your own.
