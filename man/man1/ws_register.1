.TH ws_register 1 "March 2013" "USER COMMANDS"

.SH NAME
ws_register \- create links to valid workspaces

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ws_register
[\-h] [\-F FILESYSTEM]  DIRECTORY

.SH DESCRIPTION
Create links to 
.B workspaces
of the calling user in DIRECTORY and remove links pointing to removed workspaces.
The action can be restricted to 
.B workspaces
in a certain FILESYSTEM.


The idea of the 
.B workspace 
is to allow the administrator to keep control of filespace in working filesystems,
and to avoid the situations that data of past and finished projects/jobs is idling for
ever on disks. A user can create and dispose arbitrary number of workspaces, they are cheap,
and can be created e.g. for each job.

From the system side, 
.B workspaces 
will be deleted after beeing expired. A friendly user can release workspaces before the expiration
date using
.B ws_release
which will mark the 
.B workspace 
for future deletion and make the data unavailable.

Deletion is probably a task done once a night and not immediately.

If a
.B workspace
was forgotten and expired, it might make sense to contact the administrator,
as he probaly can restore a workspace for some time, if disk space is not low.
